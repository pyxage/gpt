now start

recording good day guys um we're doing

this call to as a reach out to everybody

in the kimb Comm Community to uh help a

lot of you guys get started properly if

you haven't started yet um I'm gonna go

through this morning a little bit about

my background uh what I've done where

I've got to where I am how I came across

Climbo um and how how to get started and

get started fast and I think the main

reason is in this business we tend to

overthink it we tend to think we need to

do all these magical things to go get in

front of a customer where we don't it's

incredibly simple and we're going to

walk through that to show you how you

can get up to you know 10 20 50 100

locations pretty quickly so my name's

Wayne Connell uh my background is direct

sales to be quite transparent I started

in direct sales in

1992 so probably 30 years now I've been

in sales um I'm 54 years old I live and

work from home on the Sunshine Coast in

Queens and with my wife we've got two

parts to our business we've got our

software solution part which is our CIMB

solution um and we've also got a web

design business so it's my wife's baby

she does web design graphic design and

we do all that and the great thing with

that we've means we've got multiple

passive incomes we've got web hosting

we've got clim

we've got a couple other sash products

we use as well but where I started in

direct sales I started door too selling

alarm systems uh domestically for

roughly $3,000 on

29.95 interest

rates so you think the interest is high

now so we started off selling that door

too and that was just knocking on doors

in residential

neighborhoods uh with a free giveaway uh

with the provisor to get in there to do

a

presentation and I did that for 16

years so it's fair to say I've knocked

on tens of thousands of doors and done

thousands of presentations um I have

been a sales trainer in that area as

well and a sales coach over the years

over the years I've had multiple

different businesses and different

identities in the fact that how I've

reinvented myself but it's always been

around sales the only thing that's

changed has being the product does that

make

sense yeah so in selling clbo I came

from my first software selling was

selling Wi-Fi to hospitality was a Wi-Fi

marketing product with selling that I

got from zero to 50 clients within about

five months doing exactly what I did

with

Climbo which going out speaking to

business owners offering a free trial

and solving a problem so in doing that

you need to be prepared okay does that

make

sense in every sales job you need sales

tools now my sales tools my number one

sales tool is

this just a little flyer which I put in

the group before you can see I've got

stacks of

them when I'm out seeeing businesses my

mission is to give at least 25 of these

away every day that I'm out there doing

clim up

now if I don't get to and I'll tell you

exactly what I say in a moment um but if

I don't get to see the business owner I

leave

this and say it's important that the

business owner gets this can you make

sure they get it for

me that's the only information I give

them the QR go code goes to my website

my website is just the white label kbay

website that's it we sign up for a free

trial it goes into a form into my CRM

and I manually set them up at the moment

um but that's that's it right my

headline on that fly is quick reviews

get up to 47% more

reviews do you think that will get a

business owner's

attention because that's all we need to

do is get their attention and my last

line on that flyer which I I'll I'll

send this to AKA there's a raw file so

you got is in a canva link so you guys

can put it up in the community

it says the last line if your last

review was more than 30 days old your

business is dead in

search so in saying that if I'm speaking

to the business owner when I walk in

first thing I say is Hi would the boss

or the business owner be

in yes no maybe right if they say yes

can I grab them for 30 seconds if that's

okay I only want 30 seconds of their

time because remember there's one thing

business owners don't have today what is

it it's

time so we're g to help them solve that

problem as well so when so they'll go

yep can I grab them quickly for 30

seconds they come out I say hi sorry my

name's Wayne your name is okay AA love

you to meet you AA I know you're

incredibly busy I'm not going to keep

you too long at all today but quickly

tell me how do you um how on sorry let

me start again my brain went further

than my mouth so I'll say quickly on a

scale of 1 to 10 how important are

reviews to your business right

now if he says five or six or might not

a problem have one of these explain what

we do to help businesses like you I'm

out the

door because if he doesn't care about

his business why should

I does that make sense I'm not going to

play with tie kickers VI like seven or

above I'm like fantastic AA you're the

business owners we love to work with

sorry what I do I help business owners

like you get more customers get more

phone calls whatever that business may

need so if it's a restaurant or a cafe

or a bar it's customers if it's a a

trade service a plumber they need more

phone

calls does that make sense so I just

change my wording to suit the business

so I help you get more customers through

your door more phone calls by way of

getting you more reviews so tell me okay

how do you currently get your

reviews you know what they say I don't

know they just turn

up so if I could show you a way I could

get you up to 47% more reviews than

you're currently getting without you

doing much different to what you're

doing right now would you be happy to

have a look at

it now how long was that

pitch 30

seconds I've come in under my timeline

and under my promise right they go well

how's it work fantastic I'm glad you ask

what we going to do we're going to set

you with an absolute no catch no card

free trial now if you going want to do

cards and go through stripe and do all

that you can I'm not against it I go no

catch no card free trial all I need you

to do you got your if you got your

mobile phone handy

I just need you to scan this QR code and

we'll get you

started simple Qi go goes to a website

with a link to the free trial and we get

them going that way I set them

up right and I set them up for Success

so if they're a cafe or a restaurant or

a bar we got artwork I think I've shared

in the group before but I happy to

reshare it again templates of artwork

with know greatest Fe back we can get is

a is a customer review scan here to give

us a review and all I do if it's a

restaurant I go okay they a burger place

I'll put the photo of a burger in I'll

put their QR code my brand down the

bottom always powered by quick

reviews and I print that off take it

back to them and I get them started now

if they're remote I'll email it to them

and tell them to print it

out

okay get them started properly business

owners don't have time and they

lazy if you ask them to print out their

QR code they

won't we need to hold their hand now

what's the cost of a letter size piece

of paper

today buger roll I got a printer in the

back here color printer I print five off

I even buy um holders for them like

letter size a for holders and I put them

in there and take them out I take the

holders back if they don't go ahead with

the trial but also go I've got tap and

Go

Cards I've got a printer for them which

I print my own own one of these and

program them up with

NFC um I've got a book that I write I

give to them as well of how to master

you know local guides and all that sort

of stuff right but I've spent I don't

know how long I've been with kbo but

I've been in reputation over two years

and I got chat gbt to write me that book

in 20

minutes I got my wife did the artwork I

took it to my printer and got it printed

so if I'm at networking events this is

what I

take I've got postcards I send out so

these

are like you're you're

invited and they got nice in there so

what I'm saying guys if I I've invested

in my own business to make it

successful right do I do teley marketing

no I hate teley marketing I don't do it

do I do email marketing no I hate it I

don't do it I've got email sequences

when they' started a free trial that I I

work on I've got if they've shown some

interest somewhere I've got an email

sequence for that but I don't do cold

calling on the phone and I don't do

email marketing because in Australia at

least even my business we do SEO and all

that for a living right I get a thousand

emails a day again we look see your

website and they didn't they didn't look

at my website they just a blanket email

so people are over that and the key to

this business why people are so

successful in it is business owners love

to deal with local

businesses they're over dealing with big

corporates they like to do it you

because you're local and you can answer

their question in a nanc if they ring

you or they chat with you or things like

that so in saying that what are the

objections we get how much does it cost

who's had that who's had that questions

hands

up now everyone's pricing would be

varied I charge 199 299 and 399 a month

now I've got different Services I plug

into the different levels but my base

entry is1 199 a

month now if a business goes wow that's

a lot of money you it sounds like a lot

doesn't it but let me break break it

down to you this way so AA if I was to

put an employee in your business to work

for you 24 hours a day seven days a week

without a sick day without annual leave

without holiday pay without medical all

that and they all their one job was to

take care of your online reputation grow

your local

rankings and respond to

reviews if I was to put that employee in

your business today for $6 60 a day

would you hire

them because that's $1 199 a

month 299 a month is 990 a day 3.99 Is

1330 a

day it's a cheap automated

employee I can guarantee our software

will never take a sick

day you don't have to pay it an your

leave anything that right so remember

we're solving problems these business

owners don't have

time so I if I'm having an in-depth

conversation I'll talk about the

algorithm I'll talk about all this sort

of stuff it confuses

them now who understands a Google

algorithm in local business no

one you a lot of businesses have wasted

you know the average SEO component out

there right now is500 a month in

Australia for someone the pay someone to

do SEO

right so19 200 200 bucks a month is

cheap for organic

SEO now I can show you I've G I've put a

couple of case studies in the group I've

got another one which I I'll finish

today and put in

there one of my best success stories is

a local concreter we've got down the

Gold

Coast Luke he was paying 50 bucks a day

on Google ads to get phone calls to get

concrete in Drums he wasn't getting a

lot of concreting

jobs so he hired a marketing company to

run his payperclick ads so now he's

spending 1,400 a month plus 50 a day and

still wasn't getting

results now he rang me we've done

business before a few years earlier and

he went oh I don't know why I didn't

think of you what can you do for me I

said well let's just start getting you

customer

reviews so we connected his his

accounting program which in Australia is

called zero which is no different to

QuickBooks Online

we connected that so every time he marks

an invoice paid or final payment two

days later the customer gets an

automated review request we took him

from four reviews I think he's at 30 or

40 reviews now right it's not a lot

still but his calls last month were 40

calls for the

month that's a 7 100% increase to this

time last

year who do you think his favorite

person on the planet is right

now he refers me to that many businesses

it's

ridiculous because what did we do we

solved a problem with

his now he's on a manual invoice with me

because it's why we set it up in the

beginning now he gets it he gets seven

days to pay it he pays it within 20

minutes of receiving

it every every every time I'm his first

Billy

pays what do I have to do for him now

what what technically do I

do

nothing I log into his account I make

sure everything's still working and I

make sure we're getting results I am an

admin of his Google account so I can see

the results here as well but guys it's

not a complicated business it's not hard

to sell it's a seven minute sale with a

seven minute

setup set up

properly but we all overthink it we talk

about the algorithm we talk about

ranking we talk about this we talk about

that quite simply if you want to delve

into the

algorithm reviews S reviews signal to

Google that your profile is active and

your business is

active if you're responding to those

reviews your profile is highly

active because Google loves content

reviews the

content by giving more reviews and

replying reviews where double dipping on

the content so Google's algorithm looks

at that goes you're giving more content

than your competitor I'm going to put

you higher in search because your

business is important to what people are

looking

for that's the algorithm in a

nut does that make

sense so is selling reviews hard no is

getting in front of a customer hard

that's the hardest part of what we do

getting to the decision maker now I can

tell you from experience using

these 80% of my clients have come from a

fly drop seven to 10 days after I

dropped it off to the

business because they've got it it's on

their desk it's on their to-do

list and sometimes I'll ring the number

at the bottom sometimes I'll just sign

themselves up for a free trial so don't

be AF afraid just to drop all these off

if I'm in what we call in Australia an

industrial area which is factories where

they they're pool builders concreters

electricians and plumbers and that's

their factores I'll just drop them into

the letter

box and sometimes I'll do it three times

in a month in that same

area why it's repetition they see it

they see it again they see it again they

go wow I could I should do this so

example of one of the clients we got on

which is a their hair product place they

down in Kabula which is about an hour

drive from here I had to go there to see

another client I hopped out I dropped

off 50 of these and picked up two

clients one was a hairdressing thing it

took them a month to get on to me when I

went down for the meeting this was

sitting on the wall above their

desk it's glued to the

wall so what's I tell you that it was

important to

them so now these they're not thick

they're thin paper they're easy they're

cheap to print now in America I'm not

sure about Europe and stuff but printing

is expensive in Australia compared to

the rest of the world um but I think I

got last batch I got was

2,000 and I think it cost me50 bucks for

2,000 now my mission is to give them out

by Christmas

so I'm ramping up again now that we had

a couple of weeks where my wife had

medical issues so we uh I just stopped

and took care of her that's the joy of

this business so in in saying that

getting to the business owner don't

waste their

time don't there's no need I had when I

started a big PowerPoint

presentation Google all Google reports

Google this Google that and no I wanted

it they're like what do you do for me

what's it going to cost and what problem

will to solve so I'm going to save them

time right I'm GNA save the money and

I'm gonna make the

money that's it now on my high packages

I'll I'll I'll say I have to connect to

your Google account you have to make me

an admin and we'll respond to your

reviews for

you using the

AI CU sometimes they're just too busy to

do

it but my retention rate of my client is

around about

98.3% to be

precise why is my retention so high I

take care of my clients I monitor what

they're doing I make sure they're

getting reviews one of our best success

stories is a Shopify

store we connected them they were the

hardest client of had to deal with

they're just pain in the ass

and I said to them in their free trial

they were

difficult and I said to them look if you

guys want to

continue with this software you're gonna

have to be on my higher

package and they're like why I went your

hard

work you know I don't want to let you

have the software unless you're going to

pay premium dollars for it so when we

started with them they had 42

reviews this is less than a year ago as

we sit today they're at

368

do you think Google loves

them and they were 4.2 they now they're

4.8 right 100% automated for their

Shopify

store the minute it's Mark dispatched

name an email it's on a 15-day

delay and then they they get sent the

request because they ship worldwide so

we so but guys with

what um who's speaking there I'll gra

your water here quickly Sean okay M mute

was so guys as matter is getting out

there and crunching the numbers that's

all selling is now remember the worst

thing a business owner can say to you is

I'm not

interested now not a problem go give it

to the

competitor now in the chat if you get

the chat open I want you to if if you

haven't got a yet just type in the

number one into chat if you have got

zero

locations okay we got a couple there if

you've got less than five type in

two we got a few people that haven't got

them yet few people got a

couple okay so what my advice to you in

is in in this respect who and if you if

you know if if you got a friendship with

the local business owner type three into

the

chat now friendship can be it's your

local coffee shop you go to it can be

your hairdresser your Baker your

Candlestick Mak go give them the

software for free

forever why they're a case

study give away the software to one or

two locations forever my local coffee

shop they've got the my software for

free they've had it forever I get free

coffee

it's a great

deal right I'm ahead of the game on that

trust me drink a lot of coffee but there

a case study of mine we took them from

160 reviews to 400

now right and I use them and if I if I

if anyone asks I might ring Gary for

Patron coffee he'll verify what we

do he knows not to tell him he doesn't

pay for it but what's your true cost

you've already paid for this

software go give it away to one two or

three businesses in a different

niches so you got case studies on each

now I've got I've put case studies in

the group before I've got a few more to

put up yet and you can use my case

studies they're white labeled I haven't

put my Logos or anything on them you can

use them for your own benefit I'm quite

happy to use that because I know when

you get started you need social

proof uh and the other thing I recommend

if you don't have your own Google my

business page set one up or if you're

setting up a demo account give it that's

like sorry I'll backtrack a little bit

sorry your free location you give away

your coffee shop as part of that deal

you're using them as a demo account so

you can have your TAP Ando card or some

artwork with a coffee shop and go just

scan that for me and I'll show you how

the software

works

because you imagine the par that you're

in front of a business own you go do me

a favor get your mobile just tap or scan

that QR code for me this is the demo

this is how it

works My Demo goes straight to my own

quick reviews Google Google profile and

I'll say do me a favor press one

star and show them how it works do me a

favor now and press four or

five now if that's not powerful enough

to convince them to have a free trial

what

is so do me a favor type one into the

chat if you're going to go give away a

free location in the next 24 48

hours because this one giveaway will

make you tens of thousands of dollars

trust

me cool everyone everyone's on board

Chris is going to give away four or five

look of it and guys you you paid for the

software stop fluffing around and

stuffing around overthinking it go speak

to 25 to 30 businesses a day or if

you're not comfortable to speak to

businesses put them in the letter

box just get out there and hustle and

that's how you get success quickly now

I've built these tools over a couple of

years right because when I start in any

software business I don't tip a lot of

money into it because I want to make

sure it's going to work I just get out

and hustle so I might spend 50 bucks on

Fliers and that will get my business

started then I'll get the website up and

running then I'll get this then I'll do

that then I'll buy my ID card printer

then I'll get cards done and books

printed I reinvest into my business

every single week I haven't run one paid

ad the only only social media I do is

Tik Tok and that's educ Tik Tok about

Google about how the reviews work what

the power reviews in things like that

and have I got a few leads yeah I got a

couple but it hasn't been

groundbreaking but I do that when it's

bucketing down rain here and I don't

want to go door knock or it's stinking

hot here and I you know got lots of hair

and I don't want to get burnt

head but guys you get out there and it's

consistency is key this is not a side

hustle this is not a Tik Tok hey pay get

my affiliate link and I'll make a

million dollars get out there and it's

hard work that pays

off right crunching the numbers is what

pays off 25 to 30 of these a day

consistently for 30 90 days 90 days

minimum if you're doing if you're only

can do two days do it every two days the

two days you can do it but do 25 or 30

if you only can do one day do it 100 in

the

day now I dropped my wife off and my

mother-in-law off yesterday to some Spa

thing they were doing there was 22

letter boxes at the front of this place

what did I do it was raining I dropped

22 of these off guess how them that took

me less than a minute to put them into

22 letter

boxes this is not hard guys it's very

simple and set the client up properly

when you set them

up make sure they're going to use the

software if you're doing a free trial

monitor the free trial if there's no

data coming through the analytics in 24

48 Hours of scans at least scans of the

QR code ring him go back and check

because the staff member I can guarantee

is put the artwork behind the counter

somewhere and you occasion I I'll print

off a few of these because they C cost

me like a buck

each I've got coming I've ordered 100

from China which are like coasters they

uh epoxy resin coded

coasters they they're all they just got

the NFC so I haven't got them QR code

this is NFC it'll be tap tap toiv

review and I can set them up on a free

trial if I want to now if they go ahead

with their free trial do I want to I can

charge them a setup for $199 if I want

to keep all the marketing material

that's up to

them that the QR code on that one would

lead straight to their review site

straight to their their climb account

primary answered that one that QR code

leads to my website which is just I had

another website when I was in reputation

before with another company and then I

found kimb migrated and took all of my

customers with me now some of you know

me from that that software

um I had 100 100 and something

customers and I took them all with me to

kimb because kimb is a better

software now it was easy because most of

mine were on zapia so I just changed the

endpoint but I've now got the kleb white

label website uh I've tweaked it a tiny

bit made a little bit personal put my

booking color in there and a couple

other things but yeah feel free if you

want to go to my site and have a look

and pinch the ideas from there go for it

it's just quick reviews.com I'll put it

into the chat pinch all the

information because it's all climb

information you've already

got I think the only difference there is

my packages um you can sell Climbo for

whatever you like and every Market is

different um so you know sell it to suit

your

Market you don't need to sell for 99299

3.99 a month if you're not comfortable I

did a um I had a client there on a free

trial I know she's not going to use a

software flat out she's not that type of

really busy

business and I just rang her I said look

I'm going to make you an offer give me a

video

testimonial and I'll give you the

software for life for 750 bucks a

year you got to pay it up front pay it

annually she's like

done right doesn't hurt me but it helps

her but but the part of the agreement

was she can't tell anyone what she paid

but she has to give me a video

testimony video testimonies for what we

do are so

powerful you I've got 40 or 50 Google

reviews on my Google profile but video

testimonials are so

powerful so get your case studies

together and tell if you're giving the

software weight or customer part of that

giveaway is they've got to give you a

video testimony after 30 or 60 days

and I would sit there take your iPhone

with you hold it up and just interview

them or use our software to get your own

video

testimonals that works as

well okay so at this point any now type

in the chat is anything in particular

you want me to

cover or open up your mic and ask me ask

me a question if you

like we'll go to Q&A now because this is

this is not rocket science in selling

this

product I do have a question can you

hear me this is Manny hi Manny how are

you good thank you for putting this

together uh in terms of enrolling your

clients obviously uh they come to your

website uh how do you enroll them do you

have an admin or do they call you do

they reach out to you on the website you

know what's I've got a free trial sign

up form on my website I've got you know

I've had I've been in software a long

time I've got my own CRM that I use so

this the form goes to my CRM I get a

notification that I've got a new free

trial sign up a text they get an email

with their logins okay then I quickly

manually set them

up I I manually like to set all my

clients up um and then they get in the

email there's video tutorials of how to

connect their Google my business and

things like that as well so you're

pretty primarily focus on driving them

to your website to a free trial yeah

unless I'm talking to them face to face

and I'll just sign them up on my mobile

phone that's a genius thank you yeah and

again business owners are lazy they

won't they might fill out the free trial

form but they won't do the rest I do it

for

them because remember if someone's going

to pay you

$2,388 a year and let's say your average

Lifestyle

life cycle three years that's seven

nearly Seven Grand to do effectively 20

minutes worth of

work right get don't be lazy help your

client be

successful Quick One Way fix way I think

it's absolutely brilliant what you're

doing you're you're front you're you're

a man of my heart going out there

knocking on doors or already panning him

down to get that business but being the

lazy sort that I am I love Telly sales

by the way

guy yeah I just I do enjoy it but I but

because my this was I bought the

software when I saw it I went oh that'd

be a good birthday present so I bought

it and I thought it was a bit of side

hustle so I set everything up but I've

not done anything with it you know you

you very kindly helped me out to set

that up and I thank you very much for

that the stri you Absol genius on that

but I think the way that I I think your

leth light is been because I do we do

I'm a property sourcer and buyer and

developer so we do leaflet and I have

leaflet in the P done a lot of

leafleting in the past so that's a great

call so I'm just going to bombard the

take leaflets and just whack them out

locally it cost me about 800 to do a

th000 leaflets yeah that's wrong 800 to

do 10,000

leaflets yeah that's

really yeah it's cheap well our systems

I've been in this space the biggest F

I've seen people make is they just don't

go and do it yeah well that's that's any

business way that's that's a natural

people all the people that look all the

people that got the software there will

be 20% of people that actively use it of

those 20% only 80% only 80% of those

only 20% of those will actually make any

serious money yeah so you're one of

you're one of the you you're you're one

of the top sort of you know 2% of that

and and trust me I've got a great sales

background but I'm nothing special I

just do the work yeah that's it you've

got you hit the N Headway

and there is days I get I get

guny we all get them I get gunshot I get

fear of rejection I get everything that

we all happens that's the mixure of the

beast but then I sit there and go you're

a just do go and do

it the worst thing I tell you is not

good jfi jdf it just do it yeah

they can't sack

me that's a beauty of it I love it I

love it Wayne you're spot on with what

you're doing it's perfect

brilliant we can help you guys no no my

pleasure you can help you guys get out

there and and get over the fear of

rejection because they're not rejecting

you as a person you know I've been I've

been rejected by some of the prettiest

women in the world at nightclubs that

hurts more than a business own telling

me

no okay any other questions I have a

question for you get far away yeah so um

I in the chat I I just got access to the

platform and I really haven't even

gotten there to see how it works yet um

between a full-time job as a developer

and then having my own

agency uh getting this going has

been a very slow and cumbersome process

for me I heard you say that you're using

uh AI to do the reviews is there is this

is this shows how little knowledge I

have of the software yet is that

something that's already built in or you

do you have like a specific AI tool that

you're using the great thing with with

with Climbo is these guys behind the

scenes are working that hard to make our

life and our product so much better so

they've got a I reply built into the

back end of the software for the

business owner to use now the caveat it

only works on Google and private

feedback at the at the moment okay but

they have to connect their Google

profile to the software

properly right if they've connected it

to their end we can respond on their

behalf at our

end and does that require uh having like

your own open AI keys or it's already

built in oh well that's awesome so we

got we got got to got to thank Tomaso a

all the guys at clbo and Climbo whichever

way they like to pronounce it I'm not

sure I say Climbo some people say

cimbo but these guys are working that

hard behind the scenes on building this

out where this product's going to be 12

months from

now it's

gamechanging it's absolutely

gamechanging so you know and for what

we're paid to get in um you know i' I've

paid 297 a month 497 a month 200 a month

for different softwares and sash

solutions that don't do anywhere near

what this does yeah

yeah okay so big shout out to the team

and and the dev constantly working

behind the scenes and the one thing that

stands out to me about the team here is

they listen to the

community every other SAS company out

there their head is up their ass and

their ego is that big

they don't listen to their their people

on the

ground these guys listen to the

community they've got the road mapap

there you can put your ideas and all

that and get people to vote on them and

be active if you're not in the clino

school get in the clino school get

active in the community lots of great

people in there helping out everybody

we're building a perfect reseller

Community around the

world and that's why I don't mind giving

up my time at 7 AM to get out there and

and hustle and and share my successes if

I had failures hell

yes you know all that sort of stuff have

I had clients where the software didn't

work for them yeah did I charge them no

I had one free trial I was with the old

software I was with wasn't working

wasn't working wasn't working so he was

on a free trial for like eight

months I flipped him over to klebo we

started getting reviews so I extended

him another three months to prove the

concept now he pays me $299 every month

and loves

me because what did it cost me to extend

his

trial

zero couple of zaps on zap here but even

climo is working hard in the background

to make our life easier with

automations now AA asked me to talk

about goal setting this is very

important I've been very goal orientated

all my life my goal when I first started

in reputation was to get to 50 clients

50 paying customers and I knew I I

couldn't do it every day of the week I

could do two or three days a week and I

was there within six

months I gave myself eight I got there a

bit bit quicker and from 50 to 60 went

super fast 60 to 70 went quicker and so

on and so forth but set your

goals the easiest way to set your goal

don't set an income

goal set a fly drop goal

or a phone call Goal or an email goal

whatever way you're going to get out

there and hustle set the goal as

that because that's the easiest goal to

achieve so it's an activity goal

basically activity goal because if you

do the activity the numbers will take

care of

themselves now on a story of that is I

know uh in my early days of selling

alarms daugh door I had some bad weeks

and all that sort of stuff but at the

peak of my career my conversion rate if

I was in the home presenting was 1 in

1.5 it was through the

roof and I had a bad month where I I

just I couldn't sell anything I know my

head was in not in the game or whatever

so I went to my boss at the time Greg

Thomas and I said he's still a great

mate of mine and I think he might become

an agent of mine in Melbourne uh to sell

this Stu

software I said um mate I'm out I'm done

I'm burn out the industry's stuffed the

Market's bugged

I'm out he said you know he goes M you

teach this

stuff don't don't be like that look he

goes what I'll do keep keep out there

keep hustling go do 15 presentations a

week for the next month if you don't

sell what I think you'll sell I'll pay

you the commission

anyway right so yeah okay what I got to

lose I'm going to make money regardless

so I went out there and I just crunched

the

numbers because I take the pressure off

myself financially I just want to

encourage the numbers that month I did

45

presentations how many reckon I

sold 30 yep

exactly wow right and my confidence was

back everything is back because you can

have a bad week in

selling you can't have a bad month if

you're doing the

numbers so numbers matter now in people

talk about selling and closing and all

that sort of stuff this is not a hard

product to close they want it or they

don't and then in that case it's some

will some W some won't so what

next stop trying to convince a client

they need a product they're not

interested

in their competitor will be interested

in now I don't do Niche marketing

either because my my motto is if I'm

walking a strip of shops I'm speaking to

every business owner on that strip or

leaving them a flyer because if I'm GNA

look for for car dealers or auto

mechanics or pool shops I'm walking past

a thousand businesses to find

one and trust me if you call on every

business you'll be absolutely surprised

at the business that will take this

offer

up I've if I show you my back office

I've got a diversity of business I've

got Botox people I've got pool builders

I've got electricians I've got plumbers

I've got restaurants bars

cafes uh kitchen kitchen

manufacturers um

concreters it it's wide and

varied because I haven't niched it down

um I'm TR to go back a couple questions

here uh the NFC cards yep um ID

cards they you do need to print them um

because otherwise they're a blank

card um you can probably pre-order

printed ones and just get them

standardly printed with your logo all on

them and then program them yourself it's

very easy to program them you grab the

review Link in the client's back office

put that into the app on your phone and

go write the card it takes two seconds

to write NFC

card so you just buy a bunch of

um n cards and you can print them or

yeah I got I got a printer called called

badgy ID

printer um cost me a thousand bucks in

Australia it's probably way cheaper

overseas um but you got to think about

this right people are selling these

things online for 30 bucks a card 40

bucks a card now their card just goes to

Google where does our card

go anywhere the client wants really yeah

like you hit the landing page I can have

Google booking Yelp Trip Advisor

everything on

there right so added value it's a value

ad uh yeah I can show you the FL again y

so here's a fly here so I'll put it up

close and Rise it up a bit can pick

people say that all

right when can I ask you a question

y i I've always been worried that QR

codes may have limitations in a lot of

businesses um but do you think the NFC

cards because they've got the NFC chip

and the QR code on there but they're

more likely to be used people the owners

are more likely to say can you just scan

this depending on the business yeah like

my coffee shop I get free coffee they

get free software and I I printed off on

a hor

onal 20 of these I think for them and I

super glued them they've got wooden salt

and pepper sugar

boxes they put the salt and pepper not

and they glued to every single

box because what's on every table the

salt and pepper

box

yeah brilant so and I also have you know

FL the point of s Canon things like

that depend on someone so pran's got the

question about the badger printer depend

if you buy the 100 it's 100 cards if you

buy the 200 it's 200 cards before you

need a a new ink inks in Australia 79

bucks for an

ink so cost me like a buck a card

printed so but I can sell them like I've

sold them for you know get 10 cards

included in your setup for 199 bucks in

a setup

fee

so people aren't afraid to charge to to

pay a setup free either clients because

they know there's you know work that's g

into

it way sorry what would you typically

charge for a setup fee

199

199

y it's up up to you guys every country

is gon to be a little bit

different um and a little bit you know

because economies are

different now when I first started in

this space to be honest I didn't think I

could sell for $199 a month I went out

at 99 mon a month because in my head I

thought that's what was

reasonable yeah and then I Qui realized

that the problem this this software does

solve it's organic

SEO it's worth every single

s just on another note quick one if

somebody says um I was chatting away

with a group of um guys I know and they

said so is that your soft Ware they said

on the White Label I said yes well

originally when we started we bought and

we discussing in the group what should

happen we were adding features to it so

I sort of cheeky said yes now how would

you approach that what would you say to

that your software I to say our partners

are out of

Italy I'm the authorized Australian

it okay good one I like that very good

yeah I tend to I cirle around that

question very

very it sits on my domain and you know I

could say it's my software all day long

the reason I don't is if something does

technically go

wrong I can't go

support because I'm meant to be

supportive as my

software yeah yeah yeah I get that that

makes we part we partnered with a de

team out of Italy they help build that's

why I said we partner with Dev team I do

say we partner with develop

I'm the Australian reseller one of the

Australian resellers yeah haven't said

reseller yeah that's good good

call thank

you now setup and the setup is regarding

no I set them up with artwork QR code

artwork which again I'll give to AA to

put up in the community there's about 50

templates to suit every sort of Niche um

and I you know I'll do up things like

this for them

anything to make that customer

successful because if if you don't set

them up they won't do it therefore the

software won't work therefore they won't

continue with their free trial or they

go it didn't work and you can't say it

didn't work because you didn't do it

because I go I thought you meant to do

anything for

me I never thought about the NFC cars

that's a very good point because they're

key s the key po of customers ke Point

sales staff can have a card each yep

very good point and one one of our

restaurants they've got it sitting in

the build when they give restaurant Bill

very good

point right we solve problems for our

customers we don't want to create them

because the more problems we can sell

for your customer the longer they'll

stay paying the money because the last

thing if the economy tanks you don't

want to be the first person

off right they they'll they'll stick

with our software because they know

reviews get more business so now the

other thing about the auto reply AI

reply what you remember is when a client

writes a review if they go that was the

best seafood Tower I've ever

had right when someone's typing seafood

near me that's now a keyword in search

results if a AI I reply goes I'm glad

you enjoyed your Seafood Tower that's

another keyword in search results now

the customer now this is important why

you replied to negative reviews as

well sorry the customer who wrote the

review will very very rarely read the

reply who's reading the reply future

customers and that's why AI our AI is so

powerful because you can say to business

owner how many times have you had that

 review that you know wasn't

Justified but you want to respond to it

but you know your temper is going to get

in the

way let our AI respond to that

perfectly and anyone reading that review

go you know what they're been

fine so got a couple hands up here guys

we got Design One AA yeah can you hear

me yeah yep far

away okay um okay so be one second I G

try to mute something here can you hear

me

yep I have you on two computers I got

one that's got audio in camera the other

one got you on big screen but um give me

one second here let me make you hear

me okay so my question is I'm on your

website right now

and I just got the website set or got

the uh Climbo setup on our own domain yep

my question

is I'm not able to use the primary

domain yet is that tying it

up or so what D mind did you set it up

on okay so it's going to be it's Drive

Dash

reviews.com

yeah and then go ahead now you're right

I'm listening

here now the app the app to signning

into the app it's tell.

drive- reviews.com

j so what what I've got is my primary

domain which is quick reviews.com

and my software it's on app. reviews.com

so when on my website they go client

login that just takes them to the

landing page to log in so there two

different things you got the software

site which is always app.or there's a

couple different domains they can put it

on subdomains but so my app my software

sits on app. quiick reviews and my

website as in my customer website is

just quick reviews.com

okay see that's that's I think that's

what I did

wrong if you rais you should be able to

flip it around the other

way okay so I have to go through the

host to do that then yeah okay all right

I'll have to figure that out I did I

think I did that wrong yeah so yeah with

with the with your white label set up

remember you got your primary domain

whatever the do com is and then the sof

always sit on a what we call a subdomain

technically and that will be app Dot

your domain

name okay

gotcha

okay ticket with cbase support that'll

be help you as well be very good okay

yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna do that because

I think I did that wrong because I need

to build the website on that domain name

and it still won't popul or generate so

yeah I was trying to see how you did

that yeah yeah so websites on the

primary domain and the software is on

the

subdomain okay okay that's where I

messed up at okay so guys we're almost

we're just on the hour now so we're

going to get ready to wind this thing up

shortly any other questions in relation

to sales marketing objection handling

anything like

that

no no question it's been fantastic thank

you very much I have to go thank you all

I I have one question for you yeah it

far away I said I have one question for

you yeah it far away

way oh uh what made you leave

oneart uh I didn't like the new owners

to be

honest just didn't like the new owners

wasn't comfortable there um you know

they they've done a lot of things and

implemented a lot of things in the last

few months through all my ideas anyway

which is fine I just wasn't comfortable

needed a new home and found

one yeah I was over there for a second

too and I switched over so I know what

you mean yep no very very good uh Harold

from

France well uh Harold the main thing

with the business owner if they start

seeing Google reviews and consistent

Google

reviews they're happy with that because

it's more than what they ever got now

our software does if it's used correctly

get roughly 47% more reviews than asking

a

loan so and then what they will see over

especially you know 90 days 120 days if

they log into their Google my business

account they'll see a lot more traction

in their Google my business so give me

one second I'll bring one up and I'll

give you an

example an example here one second I'll

BR something share your

screen sorry I'm going to share my

screen here quickly just to give you an

idea of one

result this one

here okay so everyone can see that this

is this is our concrete guy we were

talking about before Luke so this is

September 23 so earli this year so he

had 140 profile interactions that's

means 140 people interacted one more or

another with his profile that was up

16.7% from the year before right search

was up 47% and 86

86% these are the keywords he's been

ranking

for right this is how reviews we look at

calls this important e business up 93%

in

September compared to last year website

clicks up 4% directions how do I find

you up 3% right so we go back here then

we go to September we go to

October up 480 to the year

before go to November now so 29 calls

for

October November 18 calls so far so

we're down a tiny bit there but that's

okay we go back to

August up 200% there now he was paying

50 bucks a day and not getting this

amount of

calls

you can see overall he's he's

up up in search up

everywhere that and the only difference

we did was I optimized his profile a

little bit better for him change C some

of his words here but we started Dr

review he's at 33 reviews when we

started with him he was at

four and he'd been gone four years and

successfully got four

reviews there's another one here I'll

show you this one give me a second um

this one

here that's from one hang on got a few

of these locations for this company move

this out of the

way sorry guys I hate Zoom the zoom

toolbar death of me um miniz that we go

minimize that out of

here let see businesses

so do this last

one so we got a few here we take care

of this one

here so this guy he's got 43 reviews now

when we started with him he had four and

he'd been sending his Google profile

link out to give him a review on every

single invoice for four years and got

four

reviews we connected connecting with his

software he man he manually just jumps

in after a job and puts the client name

and email in and he's at 43 reviews

now right that's impacted his business

massively right so that's they're real

results for real real

companies and the only thing we did was

start driving reviews to the platform

and now we're getting them to respond to

reviews because that's

important okay so guys we're going to

wind this thing up any other last minute

sales calls before we wind this

up no all good all silent going once

going twice sold

guys thank you so much for taking the

time out of your day I know it's

different times around the world I

really appreciate it um we'll get this

recording off to AA and put them up in

the community group um and yeah we we

might run another one down the track a

little bit further as well but guys

thanks again so much for taking the time

out of your day hopefully you got

something out of it I do speak very

quickly I apologize for that but that's
